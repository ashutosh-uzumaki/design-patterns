Single Responsibility Principle.

A class should have only one reason to change.
That is a class should have one Responsibility.

BAD CODE:-
class File{
    public String readFromFile(){
        return "reading file";
    }
    
    public String writeToFile(){
        return "writing file";
    }
    public void saveToDB(){
        return "saving to db";
    }
}

In the above example the File class should be responsible only to perform operations on file saving to db is not.

REFACTORED CODE:-
class File{
    public String readFromFile(){
        return "reading file";
    }
    
    public String writeToFile(){
        return "writing file";
    }
}

class SaveFile{
    public String saveToDB(){
        return "saving to db";
    }
}
